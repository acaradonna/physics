Collision detection

- GJK/EPA (Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi; Expanding Polytope Algorithm)
- SAT for convex polytopes; conservative advancement for CCD
- Continuous collision detection using TOI sweeps

Constraint solvers

- Sequential impulse / PGS, warmstarting, split impulses
- XPBD for compliant constraints and soft bodies
- Featherstone's algorithm for articulated bodies (later)

Fluids & soft bodies

- Position-based fluids; FLIP/APIC; MLS-MPM (advanced)

Determinism & rollback

- Stable reductions; integer time steps; deterministic RNG

WASM & mobile

- WASM SIMD + threads; SharedArrayBuffer requirements
- ARM NEON considerations

Benchmarks

- Microbenchmarks for each stage (broad, narrow, solve)
- Real scenes (stacks, chains, ragdolls)
